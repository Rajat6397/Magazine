          <h1>S</h1>
          <p class="p3">oon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of
            coding
            challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me
            emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required
            projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="p3">After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my
          head on the
          sink,
          and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes
          time travel possible: the flux capacitor!</p>
        <p class="p3">It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me while I
          was going for a
          run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series
          of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own seamless
          series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can
          view hints if that isn't enough.)</p>

            <p class="quote">"The entire curriculum should be a series of projects"</p>
          </div>
          <hr>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="p3">No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build
          up
          a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own
          understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons
          themselves are baked into projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because -
          hey
          - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.</p>
        <p class="p3">The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions
          and packing
          them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be
          coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".</p>
        <p class="p3">Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test
          after
          another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they
          experience
          when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that sense of forward
          progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.</p>

        <li>
          <h4 class="list">V1-2014</h4>
          <p class="p3">We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and
            Stanford's Database Class</p>

        <li>
          <h4 class="list">V2-2015</h4>
          <p class="p3">We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>

      </ul>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>
          <h4 class="list">V3-2015</h4>
          <p class="p3">We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course
            for these).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>
          <h4 class="list">V4-2016</h4>
          <p class="p3">We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data
            Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
            For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.</p>

        <li>

        <li>
          <h4 class="list">V6-2018</h4>
          <p class="p3">We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum
            improvement to date.</p>
